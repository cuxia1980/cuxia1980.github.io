                  <h2>The Selfish Giant</h2>
                  <p>Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the <span class="persName">children</span> used to go and play in the <span class="placeName">Giant's
                        garden</span><a href="#note1" class="tooltip2 note" id="n_note1">1<span class="tooltiptext">This would be the first note. </span></a>.</p>
                  <p>It was a large lovely <a href="#garden"><span class="tooltip2 gloss">garden<span class="tooltiptext">Allegorical interpretation of the garden.</span></span></a>, with soft green grass. Here
                     and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve
                     peach
                     trees that in the springtime broke out into delicate <a href="#blossoms"><span class="tooltip2 gloss">blossoms<span class="tooltiptext"></span></span></a> of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit. The birds sat on
                     the trees and sang so sweetly that the <span class="persName">children</span>
                     used to stop their games to listen to them. “How happy we are
                     here!” they cried to each other.</p>
                  <p>One day the <span class="persName">Giant</span> came back. He had been to visit
                     his friend the <span class="persName">Cornish ogre</span>, and had stayed with him
                     for seven years. When he arrived he saw the <span class="persName">children</span> playing in the garden.</p>
                  <p>“What are you doing here?” he cried in a very gruff voice, and the
                     <span class="persName">children</span> ran away.</p>
                  <p>“My own garden is my own garden,” said the <span class="persName">Giant</span>; “any one can understand that, and I will allow nobody
                     to play in it but myself.” So he built a high wall all round it, and put up a
                     notice-board:</p>
                  <p>TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED</p>
                  <p>He was a very selfish <span class="persName">Giant</span>.</p>
                  <p>The poor <span class="persName">children</span> had now nowhere to play. They
                     tried to play on the road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and
                     they
                     did not like it. They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over,
                     and
                     talk about the beautiful garden inside. “How happy we were there,”
                     they said to each other.</p>
                  <p>Then the Spring came, and all over the country there were
                     little blossoms and little birds. Only in the garden of the <span class="persName">Selfish Giant</span> it was still Winter. The birds
                     did not care to sing in it as there were no <span class="persName">children</span>, and the trees forgot to blossom. Once a beautiful flower put its
                     head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the
                     <span class="persName">children</span> that it slipped back into the ground
                     again, and went off to sleep. The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost.</p>
                  <p>“Spring has forgotten this garden,” they cried, “so we will live here all the year round.”</p>
                  <p>The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak,
                     and the Frost painted all the trees silver. Then they
                     invited the North Wind to stay with them, and he came.
                     He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney-pots
                     down.</p>
                  <p>“This is a delightful spot,” he said, “we must ask the Hail on a visit.” So the Hail came. Every day
                     for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates,
                     and
                     then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go. He was dressed in grey,
                     and
                     his breath was like ice.</p>
                  <p>“I cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming,” said the
                     <span class="persName">Selfish Giant</span>, as he sat at the window and looked
                     out at his cold white garden. “I hope there will be a change in the
                     weather.”</p>
                  <p>But the Spring never came, nor the Summer. The Autumn gave golden fruit to every
                     garden, but to the <span class="persName">Giant</span>’s garden she gave none. “He is too selfish,” she said. So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through
                     the trees.</p>
                  <p>One morning the <span class="persName">Giant</span> was lying awake in bed when he heard some
                     lovely music. It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the King’s
                     musicians passing by. It was really only a little linnet singing
                     outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden
                     that
                     it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world. Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North
                     Wind ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open
                     casement. “I believe the Spring has come at last,” said the <span class="persName">Giant</span>; and he jumped out of bed and looked out.</p>
                  <p>What did he see?</p>
                  <p>He saw a most wonderful sight. Through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches
                     of the trees. In every tree that he could see there was a little child. And the trees
                     were
                     so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms,
                     and were waving their arms gently above the children’s heads. The birds were flying
                     about
                     and twittering with delight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass
                     and
                     laughing. It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still Winter. It
                     was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy.
                     He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was
                     wandering all round it, crying bitterly. The poor tree was still quite covered with
                     frost
                     and snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it. “Climb up! little boy,” said the Tree, and it bent its
                     branches down as low as it could; but the boy was too tiny.</p>
                  <p>And the <span class="persName">Giant</span>’s heart melted as he looked out.</p>
                  <p>“How selfish I have been!” he said; “now I know why
                     the Spring would not come here. I will put that poor little boy on the top of the
                     tree,
                     and then I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children’s playground
                     for ever and ever.”</p>
                  <p>He was really very sorry for what he had done. So he crept downstairs and opened the
                     front door quite softly, and went out into the garden. But when the children saw him
                     they
                     were so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became Winter
                     again. Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears
                     that he did not see the <span class="persName">Giant</span> coming. And the
                     <span class="persName">Giant</span> stole up behind him and took him gently in
                     his hand, and put him up into the tree. And the tree broke at once into blossom, and
                     the
                     birds came and sang on it, and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung
                     them
                     round the Giant’s neck, and kissed him. And the other children, when they saw that
                     the
                     Giant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came the
                     Spring.</p>
                  <p>“It is your garden now, little children,” said the <span class="persName">Giant</span>, and he took a great axe and knocked down the
                     wall.</p>
                  <p>And when the people went to market at twelve o’clock they found the <span class="persName">Giant</span> playing with the children in the most beautiful garden
                     they had ever seen.</p>
                  <p>All day long they played, and in the evening they came to the <span class="persName">Giant</span> to bid him good-bye.</p>
                  <p>“But where is your little companion?” he said; “the
                     boy I put into the tree.”</p>
                  <p>The <span class="persName">Giant</span> loved him the best because he had kissed
                     him.</p>
                  <p>“We don’t know,” answered the children; “he has
                     gone away.”</p>
                  <p>“You must tell him to be sure and come here tomorrow,” said the
                     <span class="persName">Giant</span>. But the children said that they did not know where he lived, and had never seen him
                     before; and the <span class="persName">Giant</span> felt very sad.</p>
                  <p>Every afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played with the <span class="persName">Giant</span>. But the little boy whom the <span class="persName">Giant</span> loved was never seen again. The <span class="persName">Giant</span> was very kind to all the children, yet he longed for his first little friend, and often spoke of him.</p>
                  <p>“How I would like to see him!” he used to say.</p>
                  <p>Years went over, and the <span class="persName">Giant</span> grew very old and
                     feeble. He could not play about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched
                     the
                     children at their games, and admired his garden. “I have many beautiful
                     flowers,” he said; “but the children are the most beautiful flowers of
                     all.”</p>
                  <p>One winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing. He did not hate
                     the
                     Winter now, for he knew that it was merely the Spring asleep,
                     and that the flowers were resting. </p>
                  <p>Suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder and looked and looked. It certainly was a
                     marvellous sight. In the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with
                     lovely white blossoms. Its branches were all golden, and silver fruit hung down from
                     them,
                     and underneath it stood the little boy he had loved. </p>
                  <p>Downstairs ran the <span class="persName">Giant</span> in great joy, and out into the garden. He
                     hastened across the grass, and came near to the child. And when he came quite close
                     his
                     face grew red with anger, and he said, “Who hath dared to wound thee?”
                     For on the palms of the child’s hands were the prints of two nails, and the prints
                     of two
                     nails were on the little feet. </p>
                  <p>“Who hath dared to wound thee?” cried the Giant; “tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him.”
                     </p>
                  <p>“Nay!” answered the child; “but these are
                     the wounds of Love.”
                     </p>
                  <p>“Who art thou?” said the <span class="persName">Giant</span>,
                     and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little child. </p>
                  <p>And the child smiled on the <span class="persName">Giant</span>, and said to him, “You let me play once in your garden, today you shall come with me to
                     my garden, which is Paradise.”
                     </p>
                  <p>And when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the
                     <span class="persName">Giant</span> lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.
